			<p class="flavor">Usually known as "Man's best friend". Most Canus are kept as slaves, pets, or mercenaries for most of their life, but some find freedom from their masters through escaping, good behavior, or kindness. Canus are widely considered inhumane, and therefore don't have human rights, though this may be untrue for certain regions. In regions where they aren't considered human, they are considered "attack dogs", "dog maids", or sometimes even simple "house pets".</p>
			<p>Canus are humanoids with certain dog-like features. This includes almost always ears and a tail, and rarely furred forearms and hands. The specifics of these traits change with sub-race, or in the harsher side of their heritage, "breeds". Hellhounds have darker furs, and fire seems to burn in their eyes. Servants have white fur nearly all the time, but sometimes a mutation will cause them to have grey hair, their eyes look quite normal. Domestics have brown fur, and usually, have a slightly blank look in their eyes.</p>

			<p class="indent">In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p>
